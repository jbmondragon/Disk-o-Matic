# Dis-o-Matic: Disk Scheduling Algorithm

_This project is developed by **Jake Mondragon**, **Benedict Pagba**, **Justin Magne Agaton**, and **Niel Frias**_

## Overview

This application is an implementation in Java of 7 page replacement algorithms: FIFO (First-In, First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), OPT (Optimal), Second Chance, Enhanced Second Chance, LFU (Least Frequently Used), and MFU (Most Frequently Used).

## Appendix A

- Reference string length should be between 10-40
- Frame size should be between 3-10
- Reference values should be between 0-20
- User has 3 choices how to generate the data needed by the simulator (See Appendix B)

## Appendix B

Generated data can be obtained through random, user-defined input, and user-defined input from a file

- Random: the program will randomly generate the reference string and frame size.
- User-defined input: the user will input the reference string and frame size through an input screen in the simulator.
- User-defined input from a CSV file: the user will input the data by reading a CSV file.

## Installation & Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
```

```

### 3. Run the Application

You can run the simulator by:

- Clicking the Run Java button in the top-right of VS Code

### 4. Create and Run a jar file

```bash
jar cfe OPRA.jar Main -C out .
